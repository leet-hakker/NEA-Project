### Problem Identification

The laws of motion are highly repetetive and mathematically intensive. While the results of simple collisions in two dimensions are
somewhat easily calculatable by hand, once the problem becomes more complicated - such as collisions in three dimensions and fluid
dynamics - it can easily become very difficult or impossible to calculate by hand. Because the process is so iterative, calculating
the changes in a system over time would be highly suited to a computer, as these changes can be calculated hundreds of times in a
second.

This problem is best suited to a computational solution as it is complex and repetetive. The algorithms and equations required can
be written once in code and run in less than a second, making a computational solution far more efficient than calculating by hand.
Additionally, a computational solution would include the capability to visualise a system, making the results much easier to
interpret.
